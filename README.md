# Arduino-Projects
A compilation of mini projects to learn Arduino. A part of Smart Manufacturing subject

## What is Arduino?
Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online.

## Brief
This repository contains the code of 4 mini projects made on Arduino. The physical structure of all the 4 projects will be explained through this [README.md](./Arduino-Project/README.md)

1. Rain Detection Using Arduino And Raindrop Sensor
