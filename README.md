## What is Arduino?
Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online.

## Brief
This repository contains the code of 4 mini projects made on Arduino. The physical structure of all the 4 projects will be explained through this [README.md](https://github.com/Annarhysa/Arduino-Projects/blob/main/README.md)

This is the list of all the projects in this repository 

1. Rain Detection Using Arduino And Raindrop Sensor
2. Gas Detection Using Arduino And Gas Sensor
3. LED Controlling System Using Arduino And Bluetooth Modules
4. Blinking of LED Using WiFi Mode (Node MCU)

## 1. Rain Detection Using Arduino And Raindrop Sensor

Rain sensor is one of the kind of switching device which is used to detect rainfall. It is a board on which nickel is used to coat lines on the board. It works on the principle of resistance. This module allows us to measure moisture via analog output pins and it provides a digital output when the threshold of moisture is crossed. As raindrops are collected on the circuit board, they create path of parallel resistance.\
The sensor is a resistor dipole that shows less resistance when dry. When there are water droplets present, it reduces the resistance because water is a conductor of electricity and presence of water connects nickel lines in parallel, therby reducing resistance and volatge drop across it.
